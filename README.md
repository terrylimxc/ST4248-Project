## About
This is a group project by Lim Xi Chen Terry, Chan Wen Yong, Low Hon Zheng and Chew BangYao Paul done in Semester 2 of AY21/22 for ST4248, Statistical Learning Methods II

In this project, our group uses various statistical methods ranging from classical methods like Logistic Regression to deep learning using convolutional neural networks with the aim of predicting diabetes in adults as well as understanding the factors that contribute to developing diabetes. The results of our project culminated in a report as well as a final presentation which can be found in the repository as well.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2020. It contains over 400,000 respondents and their responses to a myriad of questions regarding their health, demographics, lifestyle and more.
